# Texts-from-a-Stoic: My first pet project
This idea come from the fact that I had read Seneca's Shortness of Life. Not only moving, it described the human condition so well in some cases that it might have been written yesterday. Surprising for something that was written thousands of years ago. I was thus interested to read more of the works by Seneca though I couldn't find an .... affordable enough book. 

Fortunately for me, there turns out to be a free source of the letters on (Wikisource)[]. 
Seneca wrote the letters to his friend Paulinus discussing interesting topics like "the fickleness of Fortune" and "on facing hardships". When i read his first essay, he talked about by looking back through history, all the philosophers of the past can be your teacher and friend. So why not make Seneca my friend?

On the outset, i feel quite confident of finishing this project. In a sense, no data has to be made; just extracted and channelled. But then again, i don't know what i don't know - yet.

So I'll be documenting my progress throughout this project. Specifically my difficulties and what i learnt throughout throughout the project.
