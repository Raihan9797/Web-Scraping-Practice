# Web Scraping Practice

## Why did I do this?
I created this repository to learn web scraping using Beautiful Soup 4. Specifically, I'm trying to scrape data from a Wikisource table of links that lead to other texts. Afterwards, I get the data and store it into different types of files like jsons and txt.

This is part of a personal project to make a telegram bot and the final product is here: [Texts From a Stoic](https://github.com/Raihan9797/Texts-from-a-Stoic)

## What did I learn from this?
1. Basic html and inspecting elements
To be able to extract data, we need to know what exactly we want from that data. Getting a basic understanding of html, especially its tags allows you to see a webpage in a different way. Also gave me a greater appreciation of **neatly organised code**.

2. Storing extracted data
Multiple requests onto a site like Wikisource might get you blocked! Because you are spamming their servers. Saving extracted data means you can use it in other places (like a bot). I actually make use of basic Python practice that I learnt from to do this!
